Change your default "New Tab" page into a clean and aesthetically pleasing digital placeholder.

Using the settings menu you can change the static background color of the page and add an optional image that appears in the bottom right corner. The animation of the letters floating up is not configurable as of right now and could be added to the settings in the future.

Does not change the original and typical search engine functionality of the address bar.

```
Settings menu:
- Press ESC key to set the background color and image url/ source
- On mobile devices: long press to set the background color and image url/ source
```

Recent changes:
- Update `manifest.json` to match manifest version 3
- Update description and add a static screenshot


Future work:
- Make animation of the letters optional
